its quite easy to type and watch what you type get typed into the screen and it can warp if there is too much text on the line now we will add a buttons thatll make this a bit more dynamic i hope lol OKAY ill have to take care of the wraping later i hope but for now this seems to be working well i just need to add a char var to take care of the cursor and then itll be kinda clear where you are typing :p
